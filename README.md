# CS 245 (Spring 2020) - P05

The reason I chose countSort for this assignment was because for a limited data set where , we
can predict the running time which is O(dn), where d is the biggest number in the data set (which
we know has to be equal to or less than 9999) and n is the number of items (which we know to be
1000000). Knowing these two numnbers, we can safely say that countSort is a viably fast sorting
method for this assignment.
